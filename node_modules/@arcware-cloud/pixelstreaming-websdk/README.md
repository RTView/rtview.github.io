# Arcware CloudRT Pixel Streaming WebSDK

## Introduction

Welcome to the `@arcware-cloud/pixelstreaming-websdk`, a robust solution tailored for integrating Unreal Engine's Pixel Streaming technology into web applications via Arcware CloudRT. This SDK is an extension of Epic Games' "PixelStreamingInfrastructure", enriching it with functionalities specifically designed for Arcware CloudRT. It empowers developers to deliver interactive 3D experiences of exceptional quality directly to modern web browsers, eliminating the need for any plugins or downloads.

If you are not familiar with Arcware CloudRT yet, check it out on [www.arcware.com](https://arcware.com/cloudrt).

The WebSDK is designed to bring immersive experiences, similar to those found in native applications, to the web. It's enabled for a range of applications, from gaming and architectural visualization to interactive training. Bringing high quality real-time and ensures a seamless user experience.

This README offers an initial guide to integrating the WebSDK into your application. For comprehensive instructions, including setup, configuration, advanced features, and best practices, please refer to our detailed documentation: [Arcware Pixel Streaming WebSDK Documentation](https://docs.arcware.cloud/web-integration/new-websdk).

For an in-depth understanding of the underlying technology and infrastructure, you can explore the original "PixelStreamingInfrastructure" repository by Epic Games on GitHub: [EpicGames/PixelStreamingInfrastructure](https://github.com/EpicGames/PixelStreamingInfrastructure).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before integrating the `@arcware-cloud/pixelstreaming-websdk` into your project, please ensure the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Share ID**: You must have a valid Share ID set up for your project. This ID is crucial for establishing the connection between your application and the Arcware CloudRT pixel streaming service. If you need assistance in setting up your Share ID, please refer to our detailed guide: [Setting up Share ID](https://docs.arcware.cloud/cloudrt-user-portal/getting-started/07.-preview-and-share-the-stream#share-your-project).

2. **Web Application Development Environment**: Ensure that your web application development environment is set up with either `yarn` or `npm`. These package managers are required for installing the WebSDK.

3. **TypeScript Recommendation**: While the SDK can be used with JavaScript, we strongly recommend using TypeScript in your development process. TypeScript offers enhanced code quality, readability, and will provide you with more intrinsic information during development, often surpassing what traditional documentation can offer.

### Installation

To integrate the Arcware CloudRT Pixel Streaming WebSDK into your project, you can use either npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @arcware-cloud/pixelstreaming-websdk --save
```

```bash
yarn add @arcware-cloud/pixelstreaming-websdk
```

We recommend keeping the WebSDK up to date to ensure you have the latest features and bug fixes. Regularly check for and install updates.

### Basic Usage

Below is a simple example demonstrating how to use the WebSDK in an HTML file to set up pixel streaming. This example imports the SDK and initializes it with a share ID and initial settings. It then attaches the streaming application to a div element in your HTML.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Arcware CloudRT - Pixel Streaming</title>
    <script type="module">
      import * as PixelStreamingWebSdkCore from "https://unpkg.com/@arcware-cloud/pixelstreaming-websdk@latest/index.esm.js";

      const { ArcwareInit } = PixelStreamingWebSdkCore;

      const { Config, PixelStreaming, Application } = ArcwareInit(
        {
          // Replace with your actual share ID
          shareId: "share-0be4620b-77aa-42b1-98cb-f7ee61be443?",
        },
        {
          initialSettings: {
            AutoConnect: false,
            // additional initial settings
          },
          settings: {
            // additional settings
          },
        }
      );

      document.getElementById("videoContainer").appendChild(Application.rootElement);
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="videoContainer" style="height: 1000px; width: 1000px;"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

<!-- # Configuration Options

When creating a new instance of `ArcwareConfig`, you provide an object with two main properties: `initialSettings` and `settings`.

####

`initialSettings`

This property is an object that defines the initial environment and behavior of the Pixel Streaming session. Here's a breakdown of the options used in the example:

- `ss`: This is the URL to the signalling server, which is essential for establishing the WebRTC connection. It is typically provided by your environment configuration.
- `StartVideoMuted`: A boolean that, when set to `true`, starts the video in a muted state.
- `AutoConnect`: If `true`, the client will automatically attempt to connect to the Pixel Streaming session as soon as possible.
- `AutoPlayVideo`: When set to `true`, the video will automatically play as soon as it's ready.

####

`settings`

The `settings` property is an object containing various configuration options that tailor the user interface and interaction capabilities of the streaming session:

- `shareId`: An identifier used for sharing sessions. \*Required
- `session`: The session ID, which can be used for session management and reconnection.
- `token`: An authentication token, if required by your backend.
- `infoButton`: A boolean to toggle the visibility of an information button in the UI.
- `micButton`: A boolean to control the display of a microphone toggle button.
- `audioButton`: A boolean to show or hide the audio control button.
- `fullscreenButton`: A boolean to enable a fullscreen toggle button.
- `settingsButton`: A boolean to add a settings button to the UI.
- `connectionStrengthIcon`: A boolean to display an icon indicating the connection strength.

###

Initialization Process

After configuring `ArcwareConfig`, you create an instance of `ArcwarePixelStreaming` by passing the configuration object. This instance is responsible for managing the streaming session and handling user interactions.

    const pixelStreamingInstance =  new  ArcwarePixelStreaming(config);

Once initialized, `pixelStreamingInstance` can be used to interact with the streaming session. For example, you can retrieve the application's response or emit UI interactions:

    const application =  new  ArcwareApplication({
        stream: pixelStreamingInstance,
    });

- ` application.getApplicationResponse(``string``) `: This method can be called to get a response from the application, which might include status updates or other messages.
- `application.emitUIInteraction(descriptor:` ` object | string``) `: This method allows you to send UI interaction events to the streaming application, such as button presses or command inputs. -->
